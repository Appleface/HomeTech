1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,760
since the mid-2000s I've been doing a

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,250
lot of technical work things like IT

3
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:07,919
based systems administration Network

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,130
administration systems architecture then

5
00:00:11,130 --> 00:00:13,469
I went up to you know director of

6
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:15,630
technology IT manager that type of thing

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,480
and then when I came to China I

8
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,660
continued that same trajectory more

9
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:24,269
director of technology eventually a CTO

10
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:27,810
of of a visual effects company here in

11
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:30,990
China so my background really is in

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,920
technical stuff but I resigned
 from that career

13
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:37,530
this year and I finished up writing a

14
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:40,230
book which is out now and did a couple

15
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,200
of appearances I was on TV and a few

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:45,960
pretty big podcasts and other interviews

17
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,850
and stuff like that so I've kind of

18
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:49,649
changed my purpose from doing technology

19
00:00:49,649 --> 00:00:52,949
to trying to connect with people out in

20
00:00:52,949 --> 00:00:55,260
the world and communicate about my story

21
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:57,629
and kind of kind of break out of my

22
00:00:57,629 --> 00:00:58,500
shell

23
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,810
[Music]

24
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:08,110
now

25
00:01:08,110 --> 00:01:10,400
one of the things that originally drew

26
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,650
me to technology is that no matter how

27
00:01:12,650 --> 00:01:13,580
you look

28
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,040
tattoos or you look you know wearing a

29
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:18,920
t-shirt actually as long as you can get

30
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:22,340
the work done efficiently in a good way

31
00:01:22,340 --> 00:01:23,900
better than everyone else as long as you

32
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:25,880
can kind of be a rockstar at getting

33
00:01:25,880 --> 00:01:29,570
that technological challenge solved

34
00:01:29,570 --> 00:01:31,670
they don't care what you look like no

35
00:01:31,670 --> 00:01:33,470
one cares they don't care and you can

36
00:01:33,470 --> 00:01:35,870
have tattoos on your face and horns if

37
00:01:35,870 --> 00:01:38,660
you can solve their problems then theytheir problems

38
00:01:38,660 --> 00:01:40,130
want you and so that's one of the

39
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,750
reasons that I really started to look at

40
00:01:41,750 --> 00:01:43,040
technology as maybe I can do that

41
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:45,170
because I had tattoos and I'm I'm not

42
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:49,250
kind of like a very formal guy and so

43
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:51,560
technology was what I really started to

44
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,240
look at in the beginning so at the

45
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:54,740
visual effects company I was working at

46
00:01:54,740 --> 00:01:56,930
here in Beijing I worked there for four

47
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:59,600
years and it took a while to get used to

48
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:02,000
the different culture of the work

49
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,440
different work environment and that kind

50
00:02:03,440 --> 00:02:05,060
of thing I didn't have any opportunity

51
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:08,479
to try to learn John went in school so

52
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,360
all the Chinese that I know is from just

53
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,860
asking people what are you saying what

54
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,480
what is that I'll say it again

55
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:15,890
what do you mean was that mean how does

56
00:02:15,890 --> 00:02:18,350
that mean so well clay shall eat the NDA

57
00:02:18,350 --> 00:02:21,019
but not too much I was doing technical

58
00:02:21,019 --> 00:02:22,790
management before I came to China and

59
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:24,950
that continued when I was here but there

60
00:02:24,950 --> 00:02:26,959
was a lot of new challenges like dealing

61
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,540
with the cultural shock dealing with the

62
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,880
cultural differences understanding the

63
00:02:31,880 --> 00:02:33,620
differences in how businesses work and

64
00:02:33,620 --> 00:02:35,660
that kind of stuff I managed around a

65
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:38,150
hundred people in six cities four in

66
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:41,209
China one in America and one in Malaysia

67
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:42,860
it was mostly technical staff but also

68
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:46,400
heavily interfaced with HR accounting in

69
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,690
the operations teams as a CTO it's an

70
00:02:50,690 --> 00:02:53,600
executive position so mumbles my entire

71
00:02:53,600 --> 00:02:56,720
day is spent with the CEO the CFO the

72
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,140
CEO oh the CCO and the vice-president

73
00:03:00,140 --> 00:03:02,180
and they all have very different job

74
00:03:02,180 --> 00:03:04,580
responsibilities but I'd say that the

75
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:07,340
CTO is most similar to the CEO Oh

76
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,620
every day I'm out there making sure

77
00:03:09,620 --> 00:03:11,600
stuff is working and people are getting

78
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,590
stuff done and movies are getting made

79
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:15,930
the way that Western people think about

80
00:03:15,930 --> 00:03:18,300
work leadership and who's in charge of

81
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,400
who and what my responsibilities are and

82
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:22,560
just all these types of things it's

83
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:23,670
totally different than the way that

84
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:26,550
people in China think about them and so

85
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:28,620
there was a lot of frustration there's a

86
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:31,440
lot of learning you know and expanding

87
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,519
and growing and being a technical

88
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:34,680
manager like a director of Technology or

89
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:37,440
IT manager you can speak the language of

90
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,330
technology to the to your juniors and

91
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,580
they can sort of work with you to get

92
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:43,470
the best solution going but being an

93
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:45,120
executive level manager is a bit

94
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:47,250
different because you interface with a

95
00:03:47,250 --> 00:03:49,080
lot of people who aren't technical and

96
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:51,989
deal with a lot more interpersonal

97
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:55,140
skills it was a lot more discovery of

98
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,140
Who I am as a manager and a leader and

99
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:00,420
there was a lot of mistakes early on a

100
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:02,519
lot of frustration and not understanding

101
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:04,080
the cultural differences and how to push

102
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:06,120
through barriers sometimes I would say

103
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,220
things that the Chinese team would

104
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,170
misunderstand what I meant and think

105
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,239
that I meant something else or they

106
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:13,319
would say something and I would

107
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:14,700
misinterpret what they said so these

108
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,320
types of things even with translation

109
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:18,690
there's a level of interpretation that

110
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:21,299
that you just kind of need to get a

111
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:23,280
rhythm for over the years working with

112
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,930
Chinese people I've learned a lot of

113
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,850
things about them a lot of things about

114
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:29,520
China and I think more importantly a lot

115
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:31,320
of things about myself you know I've

116
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:32,729
known a lot of people in my life I've

117
00:04:32,729 --> 00:04:35,280
had many friends and you know I've been

118
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:37,320
in relationships and all that kind of

119
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,350
stuff and I say that the thing that

120
00:04:40,350 --> 00:04:43,500
really strikes me about Chinese people

121
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,419
that I never knew about them before is

122
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:49,889
that I feel like Chinese people are very

123
00:04:49,889 --> 00:04:52,380
similar to myself in some ways that are

124
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:55,440
kind of interesting I feel in some ways

125
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,210
closer to Chinese people than I do my

126
00:04:57,210 --> 00:04:58,860
own people even though I have of course

127
00:04:58,860 --> 00:05:00,419
many good friends many close

128
00:05:00,419 --> 00:05:02,460
relationships in the West no offense to

129
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,610
you guys but in general I tend to get

130
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,889
along with Chinese people a little bit

131
00:05:07,889 --> 00:05:10,139
better I think that we kind of

132
00:05:10,139 --> 00:05:12,360
understand things in a similar way you

133
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,750
know they tend to work together on

134
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:18,450
things and tend to have certain views

135
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,090
about the world and about their country

136
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:23,340
and themselves that I just really find

137
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:24,600
wonderful and

138
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:26,400
another thing that I think I learned

139
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,410
about Chinese people is that they're

140
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:31,440
really into teams right they really like

141
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,030
to build stuff as a team build things

142
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:35,790
together and to cooperate to get things

143
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:38,760
done which is really nice because in the

144
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:42,030
West you get a bunch of people who all

145
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,670
try to go and be mr. hero and go try to

146
00:05:44,670 --> 00:05:47,550
save the day and a lot of them just suck

147
00:05:47,550 --> 00:05:49,860
at what they do they just have been told

148
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,780
that they're good they they're told that

149
00:05:51,780 --> 00:05:53,250
they're amazing they're told that

150
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:54,630
they're special all the time that

151
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,490
they're this amazing person they're not

152
00:05:56,490 --> 00:05:58,410
good at their job and so you have to

153
00:05:58,410 --> 00:06:00,060
like get them all together

154
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:02,700
careful their fragile ego you know don't

155
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:04,710
insult them when try they like they're

156
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:07,380
just like babies I don't know and

157
00:06:07,380 --> 00:06:08,580
there's something different about the

158
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:10,920
way people work in China where you have

159
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:12,360
people that are kind of more focused on

160
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:14,250
getting the job done like actually

161
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:16,290
working and I have a very strong work

162
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:18,180
ethic and I you know I just really

163
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:19,380
appreciate that is something that I

164
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,990
didn't know about Chinese people there's

165
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,610
so many things that I want to say about

166
00:06:23,610 --> 00:06:25,650
Chinese people not just that work but

167
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,450
also my personal relationships with them

168
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:29,940
some of my close friends here my band

169
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,910
mates and other people that I really

170
00:06:32,910 --> 00:06:34,200
want to do some videos to kind of

171
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,040
explore the interactions and kind of

172
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:39,900
really expose what I'm talking about

173
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:42,660
because I think about these things all

174
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:46,080
the time very in-depth very detailed and

175
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,590
I come up with these opinions based on

176
00:06:49,590 --> 00:06:52,500
evidence and I think that the way that I

177
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:55,199
feel about Chinese people is

178
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,050
and you know I'd love to do some videos

179
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,890
about that

180
00:06:59,890 --> 00:07:04,310
