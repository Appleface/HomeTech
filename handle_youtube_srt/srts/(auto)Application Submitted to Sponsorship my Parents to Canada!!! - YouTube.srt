5
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:16,480

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,880
this application for parent sponsorship

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,330
in 2019 January 28 I got him I got in

8
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:28,360
I'm one of those few lucky people who

9
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:30,820
got him guys seriously why I'm saying

10
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:33,610
lucky is that they opened the

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,090
application process by 10:00 a.m.

12
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:40,720
Calgary time it's after noon Eastern

13
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:42,460
Standard Time right now I'm located

14
00:00:42,460 --> 00:00:44,800
close to Calgary that's Calgary downtown

15
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,300
here guys by 10:00 a.m. they opened it

16
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:52,300
okay so hundreds of thousand of people I

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,890
believe more sitting on the website

18
00:00:53,890 --> 00:00:56,500
refresh in a page to see when they can

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,300
submit what Government of Canada did is

20
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:00,760
you have to go to the Government of

21
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:03,489
Canada website they did not tell you

22
00:01:03,489 --> 00:01:05,110
where the link is going to be they said

23
00:01:05,110 --> 00:01:07,090
they will post it on Facebook so what

24
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:10,690
they did is by 10:00 exactly they opened

25
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:14,440
the link and fortunately for me it was

26
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,100
there right away

27
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:18,940
I went into that link pull up all the

28
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:21,490
information my name my address you know

29
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,640
my PR card number email address my

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,970
birthday and my parents so I had

31
00:01:27,970 --> 00:01:30,700
everything pre-planned I had my work pad

32
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,680
open and I just had my parents names

33
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,540
there so I already wrote down though

34
00:01:34,540 --> 00:01:36,250
their data and birthday so I had to just

35
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:37,840
copy/paste it literally through the

36
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,439
entire application although I think I'm

37
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:43,180
pretty I screwed up on one of the things

38
00:01:43,180 --> 00:01:45,909
there I think I put my country of versus

39
00:01:45,909 --> 00:01:48,369
Canada and country of residence is

40
00:01:48,369 --> 00:01:50,500
Canada I don't remember if I put Ukraine

41
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,600
or Canada and I don't know there is no

42
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:53,860
way to check it

43
00:01:53,860 --> 00:01:56,650
but anyways guys short story is this I

44
00:01:56,650 --> 00:01:59,350
was a little bit delayed because what

45
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:02,620
had happened is my wife she wanted to

46
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:04,600
sponsor her parents and I wanted to

47
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,820
sponsor my parents at the same time so

48
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:08,800
at the same time we were on the phone we

49
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,600
opened the links and she was filling up

50
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,700
application for her parents and I was

51
00:02:12,700 --> 00:02:13,780
pulling up for my parents

52
00:02:13,780 --> 00:02:15,970
cherlene couldn't open ok at the

53
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:17,230
beginning she couldn't find the link it

54
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,390
wouldn't refresh the page so she was

55
00:02:19,390 --> 00:02:21,490
about like I if you did my application

56
00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:24,490
about three minutes my wife I don't I

57
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:26,110
don't exactly know how much I'm sure

58
00:02:26,110 --> 00:02:28,180
maybe five minutes or something so what

59
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:32,800
had happened guys is they like literally

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,480
in five minutes or so they have accepted

61
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,880
27,000 applications from people who own

62
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,590
to sponsor their parents to come to

63
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:43,360
Canada from those people who have been

64
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,430
waiting for years and some of them were

65
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:47,680
waiting like to solve an 11 you know to

66
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,709
get their parents to come to Canada and

67
00:02:50,709 --> 00:02:55,600
all that like a huge mass of people who

68
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:57,989
went on the website and in five minutes

69
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:00,760
27,000 applications were done like the

70
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,920
government says about 10 minutes or so

71
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:06,550
but I think it was even faster I it took

72
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:07,810
me about three minutes to finish the

73
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,140
application because I was ready I I knew

74
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:13,209
what is required on that application I

75
00:03:13,209 --> 00:03:15,880
did it last year I didn't get through so

76
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,920
I did this year unfortunately I think

77
00:03:17,920 --> 00:03:19,810
this current application got submitted I

78
00:03:19,810 --> 00:03:22,750
got my confirmation number but it was a

79
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:25,870
crazy challenge it was like you cannot

80
00:03:25,870 --> 00:03:28,330
proofread at you and don't have time to

81
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:30,100
go through the application find out it's

82
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:32,019
like you know if they made something

83
00:03:32,019 --> 00:03:33,280
where you can preview the application

84
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,310
and just when their time comes you just

85
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:39,010
hit submit it would be easy but what

86
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:41,860
they did Government of Canada is they

87
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,420
didn't give you the link so you don't

88
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,220
know where to go on the website where's

89
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:48,070
the plate you know what to do well lucky

90
00:03:48,070 --> 00:03:49,870
I guess on which page is going to be

91
00:03:49,870 --> 00:03:51,970
where you know apply to sponsor your

92
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,070
parents on the top it was saying you

93
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:56,790
know it's going to open by afternoon and

94
00:03:56,790 --> 00:03:58,810
everything so yeah that thing

95
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:01,540
disappeared and then link to sponsor

96
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:04,400
your parents appear so luckily

97
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:05,810
just hit there and I was on the right

98
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:09,829
place guys who I'm saying is it was kind

99
00:04:09,829 --> 00:04:13,189
of a mess when I went to Facebook there

100
00:04:13,189 --> 00:04:16,220
are so many people frustrated about it

101
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:17,810
you know so many people who didn't go

102
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,570
through and it just amazes me how many

103
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:23,660
solvents are like maybe ten thousand

104
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,860
hundred thousand I don't know how many

105
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:27,770
people try to do it but what it did is

106
00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:29,810
you fill out their application and then

107
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:32,690
you click Submit and it just says sorry

108
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:35,750
like literally sorry we don't accept

109
00:04:35,750 --> 00:04:36,320
anymore

110
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:38,150
we are full you know like to wait there

111
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,639
is also a big suspicion that some people

112
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:42,979
some computer engineers might have

113
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:44,840
developed a script or something while

114
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:46,669
there is less opinions because there is

115
00:04:46,669 --> 00:04:48,860
no there is no like a clicky thing on

116
00:04:48,860 --> 00:04:50,990
the bottom you know for a googly cut

117
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:53,120
capture captain recapture something I

118
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:55,580
forgot on my website I have it so that I

119
00:04:55,580 --> 00:04:57,650
